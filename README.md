# TWSIP_ResumeParser

## Resume Parser
The Resume Parser is a Python-based tool for extracting structured information from unstructured resume text. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and regular expressions to identify and extract data such as names, contact information, education details, work experience, and skills from resumes.

## Features
* Extracts names, contact information, education, work experience, and skills from resumes.
* Supports multiple resume formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, etc.).
* Customizable and extendable for specific use cases.
* Provides structured data output for further analysis.

## NLP Techniques used:
* ## Spacy
  spaCy is an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing, written in the programming languages Python and 
  Cython. spaCy comes with pretrained pipelines and currently supports tokenization and training for 60+ languages.

* ## Regex
  Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used for matching and manipulating strings. They are powerful tools for text processing and searching.

* ## Word Embeddings
  Word Embedding or Word Vector is a numeric vector input that represents a word in a lower-dimensional space. It allows words with 
similar meanings to have a similar representation. They can also approximate meaning. A word vector with 50 values can represent 50 unique features.
